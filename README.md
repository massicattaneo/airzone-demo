**NOTE ON THE PROJECT:**

This implementation focuses on code architecture, scalability, and folder structure to ensure long-term maintainability and reusability of the component across different contexts.

‚ö†Ô∏è The current visual styling does not fully match the provided design specifications. This was a conscious decision to prioritize structure, state handling, and deliverability within the scope of this test.

üé® I can easily adapt the component to match the design visuals precisely upon request. The groundwork is in place to support styling updates with minimal effort.
